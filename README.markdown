##Der, die, das game

This game test your knowledge of noun's genders in German. Whoever has started learning German knows that genders are wichtig, wichtig, wichtig (wichtig = important)! This games offer a simple interface with which to test der, die das.

I have provided two ways of playing the game. The most interactive one is with the IPython notebook. You can also play it directly with the python scripts. `noun_game.py` implements the testing, `grapher_gen_results.py` gives the different graphs according to the user's results of the test.
