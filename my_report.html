  <h1 class="title"> Der, die, das / Report </h1>

  Thanks for playing the der, die, das game. Since you have been playing, you have been tested on <span class="data-fig"> {{ num_total_test }} </span> words. The day that you practice the most was <span class="data-fig"> {{ date_num_more_prac }} </span>. That day, you did a total of <span class="data-fig"> {{ num_more_prac }} </span> words. Du bist flei√üig :) <br> <br>
  These are the results of the day. 

  You have an overall of <span class="data-fig"> {{ per_overall_correct }} </span> correct answers. <br>

  <img src= "file://{{ current_dir }}/img/overall_results_per.png", class="image-result"> <br>

  Historically, looks like <span class="data-fig"> {{ strong_gender }} </span> is your stronger gender. You have a total of <span class="data-fig"> {{ num_correct_strong_gen }} </span> of correct answers. On the other hand, <span class="data-fig">  {{ weak_gender }} </span> is your weakest one. You have <span class="data-fig">  {{ num_correct_weak_gen }} </span> correct ones. <br>

  <img src="file://{{ current_dir }}/img/results_per_gen.png", class="image-result"> <br>

  Here are your results per date. It seems like your best day was <span class="data-fig"> {{ date_max_correct }} </span>. On that day, you had <span class="data-fig"> {{ qt_date_max_correct  }}</span> of correct responses. <br>

   <img src="file://{{ current_dir }}/img/results_per_date.png", class="image-result"> <br>

   Here are the words that, historically, you have gotten most frequently wrong. Their correct genders are provided, so you don't get them wrong next time! <br>
   
	<img src="file://{{ current_dir }}/img/wrong_rank.png", class="image-wrong-words"> <br>

	Here is how your daily evolution looks like. Keep up the upward trend! <br>

	{% if more_once %}

	The gender that shows more improvement since that last time you played is  <span class="data-fig"> {{ gender_big_change }} </span> . The correct responses have increase in  <span class="data-fig"> {{ biggest_change_gen_date }}</span>. On the other hand, the gender that shows the lowest improvement is <span class="data-fig"> {{gender_lowest_change_gen_date}}</span>,  with <span class="data-fig"> {{ lowest_change_gen_date }} </span>.  <br>

	{% else %}
	Here is how the historical evolution according to the genders look like. Keep on playing the game so you can keep track of your daily improvement. <br>
